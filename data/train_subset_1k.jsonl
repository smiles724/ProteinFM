The 10,12-dimethylmyristoyl side chain is synthesized by the reducing polyketide synthase gloL/GLPKS4 (PubMed:27494047). The thioesterase gloN/GLHYD exclusively interacts with gloL/GLPKS4 to maintain turnover of the polyketide side chain (PubMed:27494047). The 10R,12S-dimethylmyristic acid is then transferred to the first thiolation domain of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase gloA/GLNRPS4 by the acyl-AMP ligase gloD/GLligase, followed by its acylation to L-ornithine to trigger elongation of the cyclic hexapeptide (PubMed:27494047). L-ornithine, 4R-hydroxyl-L-proline (generated from L-proline by the dioxygenase gloF/GLOXY2), 3S-hydroxyl-L-homotyrosine (generated by gloG/GLHtyB, gloH/GLHtyA, gloI/GLHtyC, gloJ/GLHtyD and hydroxylated at C-3 by the dioxygenase gloM/GLOXY1), 3R-hydroxyl-L-glutamine (generated from L-glutamine probably by the dioxygenase gloE/GLOXY3) and 3S-hydroxyl-L-proline (generated from L-proline by the dioxygenase gloF/GLOXY2 to yield pneumocandin B0), or 3S-hydroxyl-4S-methyl-L-proline (generated from L-leucine by the dioxygenase gloC/GLOXY4 to yield pneumocandin A0) are sequentially added to the growing chain (PubMed:25270390, PubMed:25879325, PubMed:25527531). The last C domain of gloA/GLNRPS4 is proposed to be responsible for cyclization by condensation to form the peptide bond between L-ornithine and 3S-hydroxyl-4S-methyl-L-proline (for pneumocandin A0) or 3S-hydroxyl-L-proline (for pneumocandin B0). Finally, the subsequent C-4 hydroxylation of 3S-hydroxyl-L-homotyrosine and L-ornithine dihydroxylation at C-4 and C-5 are performed by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases gloP/GLP450-1 and gloO/GLP450-2, respectively (PubMed:25879325). Mycotoxin biosynthesis. Significantly decreases pneumocandin production (PubMed:27494047). Pneumocandin B0 is the starting molecule for the first semisynthetic echinocandin antifungal drug, caspofungin acetate (PubMed:25527531). Pneumocandin B0 is a minor fermentation product, and its industrial production was achieved by a combination of extensive mutation and medium optimization (PubMed:25527531). Inactivation of three of gloP/GLP450-1, gloO/GLP450-2, and gloM/GLOXY1 generates 13 different pneumocandin analogs that lack one, two, three, or four hydroxyl groups on 4R,5R-dihydroxy-ornithine and 3S,4S-dihydroxy-homotyrosine of the parent hexapeptide (PubMed:25879325). All of these cyclic lipopeptides show potent antifungal activities, and two new metabolites pneumocandins F and G are more potent in vitro against Candida species and Aspergillus fumigatus than the principal fermentation products, pneumocandins A0 and B0 (PubMed:25879325). Moreover, feeding alternative side chain precursors yields acrophiarin and 4 additional pneumocandin congeners with straight C14, C15, and C16 side chains. One of those compounds, pneumocandin I, has elevated antifungal activity and similar hemolytic activity compared to pneumocandin B0, the starting molecule for caspofungin, demonstrating the potential for using gloD/GLligase for future engineering of new echinocandin analogs (PubMed:27494047).

The presence of multiple repeats of \"AGDR\" indicates a low-complexity region, which is often involved in structural or functional roles such as flexible linkers or interaction sites. The sequence also contains a cysteine-rich region, which could form disulfide bonds, stabilizing the protein structure. The presence of a TSR (thrombospondin type-1 repeat) domain is suggested by the sequence motifs, which are known to mediate cell adhesion and are often involved in interactions with extracellular matrix components. The overall sequence characteristics are consistent with a protein involved in host-pathogen interactions, possibly related to the Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein, which is known for its role in malaria parasite invasion of host cells.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nEssential sporozoite protein (By similarity). In the mosquito vector, required for sporozoite development in the oocyst, migration through the vector hemolymph and entry into the vector salivary glands (By similarity). In the vertebrate host, required for sporozoite migration through the host dermis and infection of host hepatocytes (By similarity). Binds to highly sulfated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the surface of host hepatocytes (By similarity). In the vertebrate host, binds to highly sulfated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the surface of host hepatocytes and is required for sporozoite invasion of the host hepatocytes. Localizes to the cytoplasm and the cell membrane in oocysts at day 6 post infection and then gradually distributes over the entire cell surface of the sporoblast and the budding sporozoites. The N-terminus is involved in the initial binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the surface of host hepatocytes (By similarity). The N-terminus masks the TSP type-1 (TSR) domain which maintains the sporozoites in a migratory state, enabling them to complete their journey to the salivary gland in the mosquito vector and then to the host liver. The unmasking of the TSP type-1 (TSR) domain when the sporozoite interacts with the host hepatocyte also protects sporozoites from host antibodies (By similarity). The TSP type-1 (TSR) domain is required for sporozoite development and invasion. CSP has two conformational states, an adhesive conformation in which the TSP type-1 (TSR) domain is exposed and a nonadhesive conformation in which the TSR is masked by the N-terminus. TSR-exposed conformation occurs during sporozoite development in the oocyst in the mosquito vector and during host hepatocyte invasion. TSR-masked conformation occurs during sporozoite migration through the hemolymph to salivary glands in the mosquito vector and in the host dermis. The GPI-anchor is essential for cell membrane localization and for sporozoite formation inside the oocyst. During host cell invasion, proteolytically cleaved at the cell membrane in the region I by a papain-like cysteine protease of parasite origin (By similarity). Cleavage is triggered by the sporozoite contact with highly sulfated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) present on the host hepatocyte cell surface (By similarity). Cleavage exposes the TSP type-1 (TSR) domain and is required for productive invasion of host hepatocytes but not for adhesion to the host cell membrane (By similarity). Cleavage is dispensable for sporozoite development in the oocyst, motility and for traversal of host and vector cells (By similarity). O-glycosylated; maybe by POFUT2. The sequence of the repeats varies across Plasmodium species and strains.

Tha biosynthesis starts with the HR-PKS aurA that selects propionate as the starter unit; synthesizes a hexa-ene chain through the repeated functions of the KR and DH domains in the first six iterations; selectively introduces three alpha-methyl substitutions at C4, C6, and C16 using the S-adensylmethionine-dependent cMET; and shuts off KR and DH in the last three iterations to afford a 1,3,5-triketo portion that can undergo intramolecular cyclization to yield the alpha-pyrone intermediate (PubMed:26340065). AurE may act as a cyclase and enhances the rate of pyrone formation and product release of aurA (PubMed:26340065). The methyltransferase aurB then methylates the C17 hydroxyl group (PubMed:26340065). C17 methylation is required to initiate epoxidation by the downstream monooxygenase aurC (PubMed:26340065). The monooxygenase aurC and the epoxide hydrolase aurD can iteratively transform the terminal triene portion of the methylated precursor into the dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold of aurovertin E. Epoxidation modifications of the precursor occur in two separate steps; bis-epoxidation of the two terminal olefins takes place first, followed by another epoxidation that occurs at C7-C8 after tetrahydrofuran formation (PubMed:26340065). The O-acyltransferase aurG converts aurovertin E to aurovertin A (PubMed:26340065). Polyketide biosynthesis.

The presence of a signal peptide is indicated by the hydrophobic stretch at the N-terminus (MEFGLSWVFLAGILKGVQ), which is typical for secreted or membrane-bound proteins. The sequence contains motifs characteristic of immunoglobulin variable regions, such as the conserved cysteine (C) residues and the presence of a hypervariable region (CDR) indicated by the sequence variability. The sequence also includes a typical immunoglobulin fold, with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, suggesting it is part of an antibody's variable domain. The presence of a conserved tryptophan (W) and the pattern of cysteines suggest it is part of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region. The sequence is relatively short, consistent with a variable domain, and lacks any obvious catalytic motifs, indicating it is likely involved in antigen binding rather than enzymatic activity. The description of the sequence as a probable non-functional open reading frame (ORF) suggests it may have mutations or alterations that prevent it from forming a functional antibody.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nProbable non-functional open reading frame (ORF) of V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin heavy chains (PubMed:24600447). Non-functional ORF generally cannot participate in the synthesis of a productive immunoglobulin chain due to altered V-(D)-J or switch recombination and/or splicing site (at mRNA level) and/or conserved amino acid change (protein level) (PubMed:9619395). Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are membrane-bound or secreted glycoproteins produced by B lymphocytes. In the recognition phase of humoral immunity, the membrane-bound immunoglobulins serve as receptors which, upon binding of a specific antigen, trigger the clonal expansion and differentiation of B lymphocytes into immunoglobulins-secreting plasma cells. Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:22158414, PubMed:20176268). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:17576170). Immunoglobulins are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains; disulfide-linked. There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele IGHV3-16*02. Most probably a non-functional protein that cannot participate in the synthesis of a productive immunoglobulin chain due to an unusual recombination signal (RS) sequence altering V-(D)-J recombination (PubMed:9619395).\n</answer>", "aa_seq": "MEFGLSWVFLAGILKGVQCEVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFSNSDMNWARKAPGKGLEWVSGVSWNGSRTHYVDSVKRRFIISRDNSRNSLYLQKNRRRAEDMAVYYCVR", "stru_str": "<|chain:A|> <|chain_sep|> ##################qdwdwdkdfdddddaqaktkikiqitrdqllqdkkfkwwddvpddigtakiahsprpdidgppvqppqwdwdddnvrsmimiiggrddpvpptdmdmdd"}

Formation of the active enzyme involves a self-maturation process in which the active site pyruvoyl group is generated from an internal serine residue via an autocatalytic post-translational modification. Two non-identical subunits are generated from the proenzyme in this reaction, and the pyruvate is formed at the N-terminus of the alpha chain, which is derived from the carboxyl end of the proenzyme. The post-translation cleavage follows an unusual pathway, termed non-hydrolytic serinolysis, in which the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine supplies its oxygen atom to form the C-terminus of the beta chain, while the remainder of the serine residue undergoes an oxidative deamination to produce ammonia and the pyruvoyl prosthetic group on the alpha chain.

Heterotetramer of two alpha and two beta chains arranged as a dimer of alpha/beta heterodimers. Is synthesized initially as an inactive proenzyme. Formation of the active enzyme involves a self-maturation process in which the active site pyruvoyl group is generated from an internal serine residue via an autocatalytic post-translational modification. Two non-identical subunits are generated from the proenzyme in this reaction, and the pyruvate is formed at the N-terminus of the alpha chain, which is derived from the carboxyl end of the proenzyme. The post-translation cleavage follows an unusual pathway, termed non-hydrolytic serinolysis, in which the side chain hydroxyl group of the serine supplies its oxygen atom to form the C-terminus of the beta chain, while the remainder of the serine residue undergoes an oxidative deamination to produce ammonia and the pyruvoyl group blocking the N-terminus of the alpha chain.

Plays an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by changes in the environment. Mediates signal transduction of TRAF6, various cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB), TGFB-related factors like BMP2 and BMP4, toll-like receptors (TLR), tumor necrosis factor receptor CD40 and B-cell receptor (BCR). Ceramides are also able to activate MAP3K7/TAK1. Once activated, acts as an upstream activator of the MKK/JNK signal transduction cascade and the p38 MAPK signal transduction cascade through the phosphorylation and activation of several MAP kinase kinases like MAP2K1/MEK1, MAP2K3/MKK3, MAP2K6/MKK6 and MAP2K7/MKK7. These MAP2Ks in turn activate p38 MAPKs, c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and I-kappa-B kinase complex (IKK). Both p38 MAPK and JNK pathways control the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), while nuclear factor-kappa B is activated by IKK. MAP3K7 activates also IKBKB and MAPK8/JNK1 in response to TRAF6 signaling and mediates BMP2-induced apoptosis. In osmotic stress signaling, plays a major role in the activation of MAPK8/JNK1, but not that of NF-kappa-B (By similarity). Promotes TRIM5 capsid-specific restriction activity (By similarity). Phosphorylates RIPK1 at 'Ser-321' which positively regulates RIPK1 interaction with RIPK3 to promote necroptosis but negatively regulates RIPK1 kinase activity and its interaction with FADD to mediate apoptosis (By similarity).

Interacts with RIPK1 (By similarity). Although the majority of MAP3K7/TAK1 is found in the cytosol, when complexed with TAB1/MAP3K7IP1 and TAB2/MAP3K7IP2, it is also localized at the cell membrane. Association with TAB1/MAP3K7IP1 promotes autophosphorylation at Ser-192 and subsequent activation. Association with TAB2/MAP3K7IP2, itself associated with free unanchored Lys-63 polyubiquitin chain, promotes autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of MAP3K7. Dephosphorylation at Ser-192 by PPM1B/PP2CB and at Thr-187 by PP2A and PPP6C leads to inactivation (By similarity). 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination at Lys-72 is induced by TNFalpha, and leads to proteasomal degradation. Undergoes 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination catalyzed by ITCH. 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination at Lys-158 by TRIM8 does not lead to proteasomal degradation but contributes to autophosphorylation and activation.

First reason step by step inside a <thinking> block using sequence-derived evidence and structural cues, then provide the final 2–4 sentence description inside an <answer> block.", "response": "<thinking>\nThe sequence provided is characteristic of tubulin, a protein that is a major component of microtubules. The presence of the MREC motif at the N-terminus is a hallmark of tubulin proteins, specifically alpha-tubulin. Tubulin proteins are known for their ability to bind GTP, and they form heterodimers with beta-tubulin to create the structural units of microtubules. The sequence also contains regions that are likely involved in post-translational modifications such as glycylation and glutamylation, which are common in tubulin and play roles in microtubule stability and function. The presence of these motifs and the overall sequence composition strongly suggest that this protein is involved in the formation and regulation of microtubules.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nTubulin is the major constituent of microtubules. It binds two moles of GTP, one at an exchangeable site on the beta chain and one at a non-exchangeable site on the alpha chain. Dimer of alpha and beta chains. A typical microtubule is a hollow water-filled tube with an outer diameter of 25 nm and an inner diameter of 15 nM. Alpha-beta heterodimers associate head-to-tail to form protofilaments running lengthwise along the microtubule wall with the beta-tubulin subunit facing the microtubule plus end conferring a structural polarity. Microtubules usually have 13 protofilaments but different protofilament numbers can be found in some organisms and specialized cells. Nascent tubulin polypeptide interacts (via beta-tubulin MREC motif) with TTC5/STRAP; this interaction may result in tubulin mRNA-targeted degradation. The MREC motif mediates interaction with TTC5/STRAP and may be critical for tubulin autoregulation. Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglycylated, resulting in polyglycine chains on the gamma-carboxyl group. Glycylation is mainly limited to tubulin incorporated into axonemes (cilia and flagella) whereas glutamylation is prevalent in neuronal cells, centrioles, axonemes, and the mitotic spindle. Both modifications can coexist on the same protein on adjacent residues, and lowering polyglycylation levels increases polyglutamylation, and reciprocally. Cilia and flagella glycylation is required for their stability and maintenance. Flagella glycylation controls sperm motility. Some glutamate residues at the C-terminus are polyglutamylated, resulting in polyglutamate chains on the gamma-carboxyl group (By similarity). Polyglutamylation plays a key role in microtubule severing by spastin (SPAST). SPAST preferentially recognizes and acts on microtubules decorated with short polyglutamate tails: severing activity by SPAST increases as the number of glutamates per tubulin rises from one to eight, but decreases beyond this glutamylation threshold (By similarity). Glutamylation is also involved in cilia motility (By similarity). Acetylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is located inside the microtubule lumen. This modification has been correlated with increased microtubule stability, intracellular transport and ciliary assembly. Methylation of alpha chains at Lys-40 is found in mitotic microtubules and is required for normal mitosis and cytokinesis contributing to genomic stability. Nitration of Tyr-451 is irreversible and interferes with normal dynein intracellular distribution. Undergoes a tyrosination/detyrosination cycle, the cyclic removal and re-addition of a C-terminal tyrosine residue by the enzymes tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase (VASH1 or VASH2) and tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL), respectively. Tyrosination promotes microtubule interaction with CAP-Gly domain-containing proteins such as CLIP1, CLIP2 and DCTN1 (By similarity). Tyrosination regulates the initiation of dynein-dynactin motility via interaction with DCTN1, which brings the dynein-dynactin complex into contact with microtubules. In neurons, tyrosinated tubulins mediate the initiation of retrograde vesicle transport (By similarity). Detyrosination is involved in metaphase plate congression by guiding chromosomes during mitosis: detyrosination promotes interaction with CENPE, promoting pole-proximal transport of chromosomes toward the equator (By similarity). Detyrosination increases microtubules-dependent mechanotransduction in dystrophic cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiomyocytes, detyrosinated microtubules are required to resist to contractile compression during contraction: detyrosination promotes association with desmin (DES) at force-generating sarcomeres, leading to buckled microtubules and mechanical resistance to contraction (By similarity). Belongs to the tubulin family.\n</answer>", "aa_seq": "MRECISIHVGQAGVQIGNACWELYCLEHGIQPDGQMPSDKTIGGGDDSFNTFFSETGAGKHVPRAVFVDLEPTVIDEVRTGTYRQLFHPEQLITGKEDAANNYARGHYTIGKEIIDLVLDRIRKLADQCTGLQGFLVFHSFGGGTGSGFTSLLMERLSVDYGKKSKLEFSIYPAPQVSTAVVEPYNSILTTHTTLEHSDCAFMVDNEAIYDICRRNLDIERPTYTNLNRLISQIVSSITASLRFDGALNVDLTEFQTNLVPYPRIHFPLATYAPVISAEKAYHEQLSVAEITNACFEPANQMVKCDPRHGKYMACCLLYRGDVVPKDVNAAIATIKTKRSIQFVDWCPTGFKVGINYQPPTVVPGGDLAKVQRAVCMLSNTTAIAEAWARLDHKFDLMYAKRAFVHWYVGEGMEEGEFSEAREDMAALEKDYEEVGVDSVEGEGEEEGEEY", "stru_str": "<|chain:A|> <|chain_sep|> daaeaeeqwalqslllvvllvlqlcvlvcqallqahd##########lsvnqwdqdpvrgtagsyaydfqacvslvcccpdsnvnrydplssyyhhdhpaqfllcqaqnslvvclvsnvvsnvvsvvvdphhqayeyeaeqggngrqnvvlnnlvvccvvpvvhayeyayeyealpdhpdlcslvsnllrllsclqrhlayeyfypvlvvlcccpalvdvdddvnqvsnvvsllvclvcvlsradwpfgddpvvcsvqappdsrqrywwkfkpdfhfqvcvvvdpraplvqlvvrpdqsrtrgpfrllvwawaakekrkeapddpvvnvvsvvvllpdpshhhapvcspryhyhgghhardddvvhgghrdrmmimmtirilrclvvlvsslvslcvcvvvchpvcvnvvspddpcssvvssvvsvvssvvsvvsrdhp############"}

Additionally, the sequence contains regions that could be involved in protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for the function of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes within the ubiquitination pathway. The sequence does not appear to have transmembrane regions or signal peptides, indicating it is likely a cytosolic protein.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nCatalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. Acts as an essential factor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis. Acts by specifically elongating 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains initiated by the E2 enzyme ube2c/ubch10 on APC/C substrates, enhancing the degradation of APC/C substrates by the proteasome and promoting mitotic exit.

The presence of hydrophobic residues like leucine (L), isoleucine (I), and valine (V) early in the sequence suggests a possible signal peptide or transmembrane domain, indicating that the protein might be membrane-associated or secreted. The sequence contains several lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues, which are often involved in protein-protein interactions or may indicate nuclear localization signals.

The sequence also contains motifs that are characteristic of enzyme active sites, such as the presence of histidine (H) and serine (S), which are often found in catalytic triads. The sequence does not show obvious repetitive motifs or low-complexity regions that might suggest a structural or binding role. Based on the presence of potential catalytic residues and the overall composition, the protein may function as an enzyme, possibly involved in oxidation-reduction reactions, which is typical for cytochrome P450 enzymes. The presence of multiple charged residues and potential transmembrane regions supports the idea of a membrane-associated enzyme, likely involved in biosynthetic or metabolic pathways.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nCytochrome P450 monooxygenase; part of the fragmented gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of dothistromin (DOTH), a polyketide toxin very similar in structure to the aflatoxin precursor, versicolorin B (PubMed:12039746, PubMed:17683963, PubMed:22069571, PubMed:23207690, PubMed:23448391). The first step of the pathway is the conversion of acetate to norsolorinic acid (NOR) and requires the fatty acid synthase subunits hexA and hexB, as well as the polyketide synthase pksA (PubMed:16649078, PubMed:23207690). PksA combines a hexanoyl starter unit and 7 malonyl-CoA extender units to synthesize the precursor NOR (By similarity). The hexanoyl starter unit is provided to the acyl-carrier protein (ACP) domain by the fungal fatty acid synthase hexA/hexB (By similarity). The second step is the conversion of NOR to averantin (AVN) and requires the norsolorinic acid ketoreductase nor1, which catalyzes the dehydration of norsolorinic acid to form (1'S)-averantin (PubMed:23207690). The cytochrome P450 monooxygenase avnA then catalyzes the hydroxylation of AVN to 5'hydroxyaverantin (HAVN) (PubMed:23207690). The next step is performed by adhA that transforms HAVN to averufin (AVF) (PubMed:23207690). Averufin might then be converted to hydroxyversicolorone by cypX and avfA (PubMed:23207690). Hydroxyversicolorone is further converted versiconal hemiacetal acetate (VHA) by moxY (PubMed:23207690). VHA is then the substrate for the versiconal hemiacetal acetate esterase est1 to yield versiconal (VAL) (PubMed:23207690). Versicolorin B synthase vbsA then converts VAL to versicolorin B (VERB) by closing the bisfuran ring (PubMed:16649078, PubMed:23207690). Then, the activity of the versicolorin B desaturase verB leads to versicolorin A (VERA) (PubMed:23207690). DotB, a predicted chloroperoxidase, may perform epoxidation of the A-ring of VERA (PubMed:23207690). Alternatively, a cytochrome P450, such as cypX or avnA could catalyze this step (PubMed:23207690). It is also possible that another, uncharacterized, cytochrome P450 enzyme is responsible for this step (PubMed:23207690). Opening of the epoxide could potentially be achieved by the epoxide hydrolase epoA (PubMed:23207690). However, epoA seems not to be required for DOTH biosynthesis, but other epoxide hydrolases may have the ability to complement this hydrolysis (PubMed:23207690). Alternatively, opening of the epoxide ring could be achieved non-enzymatically (PubMed:23207690). The next step is the deoxygenation of ring A to yield the 5,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone which is most likely catalyzed by the NADPH dehydrogenase encoded by ver1 (PubMed:23207690). The last stages of DOTH biosynthesis are proposed to involve hydroxylation of the bisfuran (PubMed:23207690). OrdB and norB might have oxidative roles here (PubMed:23207690). An alternative possibility is that cytochrome P450 monoogenases such as avnA and cypX might perform these steps in addition to previously proposed steps (PubMed:23207690). Mycotoxin biosynthesis.

The presence of hydrophobic residues like leucine (L), isoleucine (I), and valine (V) early in the sequence suggests a potential signal peptide, which is common in proteins that are secreted or membrane-bound. The sequence contains cysteine (C) residues, which may form disulfide bonds, a feature often found in extracellular or membrane proteins. The presence of tyrosine (Y), serine (S), and threonine (T) residues suggests potential sites for phosphorylation, which is common in signaling proteins. The sequence also contains a high proportion of charged residues like lysine (K), glutamic acid (E), and aspartic acid (D), which are often involved in protein-protein interactions. The sequence does not show obvious transmembrane helices, suggesting it might be part of a larger complex or a soluble domain. The presence of motifs like \"CAYRS\" could indicate a role in antigen recognition, typical of immune receptors. Overall, the sequence characteristics are consistent with a domain of a T cell receptor, which is involved in antigen recognition and immune response.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nV region of the variable domain of T cell receptor (TR) alpha chain that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Alpha-beta T cell receptors are antigen specific receptors which are essential to the immune response and are present on the cell surface of T lymphocytes. Recognize peptide-major histocompatibility (MH) (pMH) complexes that are displayed by antigen presenting cells (APC), a prerequisite for efficient T cell adaptive immunity against pathogens (PubMed:25493333). Binding of alpha-beta TR to pMH complex initiates TR-CD3 clustering on the cell surface and intracellular activation of LCK that phosphorylates the ITAM motifs of CD3G, CD3D, CD3E and CD247 enabling the recruitment of ZAP70. In turn ZAP70 phosphorylates LAT, which recruits numerous signaling molecules to form the LAT signalosome. The LAT signalosome propagates signal branching to three major signaling pathways, the calcium, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase and the nuclear factor NF-kappa-B (NF-kB) pathways, leading to the mobilization of transcription factors that are critical for gene expression and essential for T cell growth and differentiation (PubMed:23524462). The T cell repertoire is generated in the thymus, by V-(D)-J rearrangement. This repertoire is then shaped by intrathymic selection events to generate a peripheral T cell pool of self-MH restricted, non-autoaggressive T cells. Post-thymic interaction of alpha-beta TR with the pMH complexes shapes TR structural and functional avidity (PubMed:15040585). Alpha-beta TR is a heterodimer composed of an alpha and beta chain; disulfide-linked. The alpha-beta TR is associated with the transmembrane signaling CD3 coreceptor proteins to form the TR-CD3 (TcR or TCR). The assembly of alpha-beta TR heterodimers with CD3 occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum where a single alpha-beta TR heterodimer associates with one CD3D-CD3E heterodimer, one CD3G-CD3E heterodimer and one CD247 homodimer forming a stable octomeric structure. CD3D-CD3E and CD3G-CD3E heterodimers preferentially associate with TR alpha and TR beta chains, respectively. The association of the CD247 homodimer is the last step of TcR assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum and is required for transport to the cell surface. There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele TRAV38-2/DV8*01.\n</answer>", "aa_seq": "MACPGFLWALVISTCLEFSMAQTVTQSQPEMSVQEAETVTLSCTYDTSESDYYLFWYKQPPSRQMILVIRQEAYKQQNATENRFSVNFQKAAKSFSLKISDSQLGDAAMYFCAYRS", "stru_str": "<|chain:A|> <|chain_sep|> ##################ppdwdkdwpdpdddddaqakdktkmatddpdqwkkkwkwwqapvrdidtddmdispdpdwdddvqwtwdddnvrrmtmimggrddpvrptdmdmdmdd"}

Given the presence of hydrophobic stretches and potential motifs, this protein is likely involved in membrane-associated processes, possibly as part of a larger complex such as the electron transport chain in mitochondria.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nComponent of the cytochrome c oxidase, the last enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain which drives oxidative phosphorylation. The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inner membrane that drives transmembrane transport and the ATP synthase. Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. Electrons originating from reduced cytochrome c in the intermembrane space (IMS) are transferred via the dinuclear copper A center (CU(A)) of Cox2 and heme A of Cox1 to the active site in Cox1, a binuclear center (BNC) formed by heme A3 and copper B (CU(B)). The BNC reduces molecular oxygen to 2 water molecules using 4 electrons from cytochrome c in the IMS and 4 protons from the mitochondrial matrix. Energy metabolism; oxidative phosphorylation. Component of the cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), a multisubunit enzyme composed of 11 subunits. The complex is composed of a catalytic core of 3 subunits Cox1, Cox2 and Cox3, encoded in the mitochondrial DNA, and 8 supernumerary subunits Cox4, Cox5a/Cox5, Cox6, Cox7, Cox8, Cox7a/Cox9, Cox6b/Cox12 and Cox6a/Cox13, which are encoded in the nuclear genome (PubMed:31316820). The complex exists as a monomer or a dimer and forms respiratory supercomplexes (SCs) in the inner mitochondrial membrane with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I, CI) and ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII), resulting in various different assemblies (supercomplexes I(1)IV(1), I(1)III(3)IV(2), III(2)IV(1) and III(2)IV(2) as well as larger supercomplexes of compositions like I(1)III(2)IV(5-6)) (PubMed:17873079).

First reason step by step inside a <thinking> block using sequence-derived evidence and structural cues, then provide the final 2–4 sentence description inside an <answer> block.", "response": "<thinking>\nThe sequence analysis reveals several key features indicative of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The presence of multiple adenylation (A) domains, thiolation (T) domains, and condensation (C) domains suggests a modular architecture typical of NRPS enzymes. These domains are responsible for the activation, transfer, and condensation of specific amino acids into a peptide chain. The sequence also contains motifs that are characteristic of NRPS enzymes, such as those involved in substrate recognition and binding. Additionally, the presence of a thioesterase (TE) domain at the C-terminus suggests a role in releasing the synthesized peptide. The sequence lacks transmembrane regions or signal peptides, indicating a cytoplasmic localization, which is consistent with the function of NRPS enzymes in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The sequence is also devoid of low-complexity regions or repetitive sequences, which supports its role in specific and complex biosynthetic processes.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nNonribosomal peptide synthetase; part of the gene cluster that mediates the biosynthesis of the prenylated pyrroloindoline diketopiperazine acetylaszonalenin (PubMed:19001367). The first step in the pathway is the formation of (R)-benzodiazepinedione by condensation of tryptophan and anthranilic acid catalyzed by the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase anaPS (PubMed:19001367, PubMed:20225828). The prenyltransferase anaPT then converts (R)-benzodiazepinedione to aszonalenin in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) via C3-prenylation (PubMed:19001367). The last step in the biosynthesis of acetylaszonalenin via acetylation of aszonalenin at position N1 catalyzed by anaAT (PubMed:19001367). Alkaloid biosynthesis. NRP synthetases are composed of discrete domains (adenylation (A), thiolation (T) or peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) and condensation (C) domains) which when grouped together are referred to as a single module. Each module is responsible for the recognition (via the A domain) and incorporation of a single amino acid into the growing peptide product. Thus, an NRP synthetase is generally composed of one or more modules and can terminate in a thioesterase domain (TE) that releases the newly synthesized peptide from the enzyme.

The presence of hydrophobic residues like leucine (L), isoleucine (I), and valine (V) early in the sequence suggests a potential signal peptide, which is common in proteins that are secreted or membrane-bound. The sequence contains cysteine (C) residues, which are often involved in disulfide bonds, a feature common in extracellular proteins or those involved in immune functions. The presence of glutamine (Q) and asparagine (N) suggests potential glycosylation sites, which are typical in proteins that are secreted or part of the cell surface. The sequence also includes a variety of charged and polar residues, indicating potential interaction sites with other molecules or proteins. The presence of a variable region (V region) motif suggests a role in antigen recognition, typical of immunoglobulins or T cell receptors. The sequence is consistent with a T cell receptor alpha chain, which is involved in recognizing antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nV region of the variable domain of T cell receptor (TR) alpha chain that participates in the antigen recognition (PubMed:24600447). Alpha-beta T cell receptors are antigen specific receptors which are essential to the immune response and are present on the cell surface of T lymphocytes. Recognize peptide-major histocompatibility (MH) (pMH) complexes that are displayed by antigen presenting cells (APC), a prerequisite for efficient T cell adaptive immunity against pathogens (PubMed:25493333). Binding of alpha-beta TR to pMH complex initiates TR-CD3 clustering on the cell surface and intracellular activation of LCK that phosphorylates the ITAM motifs of CD3G, CD3D, CD3E and CD247 enabling the recruitment of ZAP70. In turn ZAP70 phosphorylates LAT, which recruits numerous signaling molecules to form the LAT signalosome. The LAT signalosome propagates signal branching to three major signaling pathways, the calcium, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase and the nuclear factor NF-kappa-B (NF-kB) pathways, leading to the mobilization of transcription factors that are critical for gene expression and essential for T cell growth and differentiation (PubMed:23524462). The T cell repertoire is generated in the thymus, by V-(D)-J rearrangement. This repertoire is then shaped by intrathymic selection events to generate a peripheral T cell pool of self-MH restricted, non-autoaggressive T cells. Post-thymic interaction of alpha-beta TR with the pMH complexes shapes TR structural and functional avidity (PubMed:15040585). Alpha-beta TR is a heterodimer composed of an alpha and beta chain; disulfide-linked. The alpha-beta TR is associated with the transmembrane signaling CD3 coreceptor proteins to form the TR-CD3 (TcR or TCR). The assembly of alpha-beta TR heterodimers with CD3 occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum where a single alpha-beta TR heterodimer associates with one CD3D-CD3E heterodimer, one CD3G-CD3E heterodimer and one CD247 homodimer forming a stable octomeric structure. CD3D-CD3E and CD3G-CD3E heterodimers preferentially associate with TR alpha and TR beta chains, respectively. The association of the CD247 homodimer is the last step of TcR assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum and is required for transport to the cell surface. There are several alleles. The sequence shown is that of IMGT allele TRAV25*01.\n</answer>", "aa_seq": "MLLITSMLVLWMQLSQVNGQQVMQIPQYQHVQEGEDFTTYCNSSTTLSNIQWYKQRPGGHPVFLIQLVKSGEVKKQKRLTFQFGEAKKNSSLHITATQTTDVGTYFCAG", "stru_str": "<|chain:A|> <|chain_sep|> ##vvvvvvvvvvv######fdkdkppqdddddaqakdkmkiftpdadqkkwkwwdavvgdtdtddiggdaqdwdddpqwiktqhnsngmimimggrddpvpdtdmdmdd"}

The presence of multiple cysteine residues in close proximity suggests the potential for RING-type zinc finger domains, which are characteristic of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The sequence also includes regions that could form coiled-coil structures, often involved in protein-protein interactions. The presence of acidic residues and potential phosphorylation sites suggests regulatory roles. The sequence does not show obvious transmembrane regions or signal peptides, indicating a likely cytoplasmic or nuclear localization. The presence of motifs resembling those in ubiquitin-related proteins suggests a role in protein ubiquitination pathways.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nE3 ubiquitin-protein transferase, which catalyzes ubiquitination of target proteins together with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 ubc-18 (By similarity). Acts with ubc-18 to regulate pharyngeal development (PubMed:16457801, PubMed:19521497). [E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme]-S-ubiquitinyl-L-cysteine + [acceptor protein]-L-lysine = [E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme]-L-cysteine + [acceptor protein]-N(6)-ubiquitinyl-L-lysine. Autoinhibited by the ariadne domain, which masks the second RING-type zinc finger that contains the active site and inhibits the E3 activity. Interacts with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 ubc-18. Expression is dynamic during early embryonic development, with ubiquitous somatic expression occurring between the 50- and 200-cell stage (PubMed:16457801). By the late proliferative phase of embryogenesis, expression is reduced, but maintained at high levels in muscle precursors (PubMed:16457801). Later in embryogenesis, moderate expression occurs in the lateral ectoderm (PubMed:16457801). Pharyngeal expression is very low at both the comma and 1.5-fold embryonic stages (PubMed:16457801). Expression is highest in muscle and neuronal cells in larvae and adults, including many of the amphid neurons that are proximal to the posterior bulb of the pharynx (PubMed:16457801). Consistent expression in cells of the somatic gonad including distal tip, sheath, and spermathecal cells, as well as in vulval cells undergoing morphogenesis (PubMed:16457801). Neuronal expression in the midbody includes the CAN, HSN, and ALM cells; neurons of the ventral and dorsal cords; and a number of posterior deirid neurons (PubMed:16457801). Expressed in all pairs of coelomocytes (PubMed:16457801). Members of the RBR family are atypical E3 ligases. They interact with an E2 conjugating enzyme and function like HECT-type E3 enzymes: they bind E2s via the first RING-type zinc finger, but require an obligate trans-thiolation step during the ubiquitin transfer, requiring a conserved active site Cys residue in the second RING-type zinc finger. The active site probably forms a thioester intermediate with ubiquitin taken from the active-site cysteine of the E2 before ultimately transferring it to a Lys residue on the substrate. RNAi-mediated knockdown on a pha-1 or on a lin-35;ubc-18 mutant background produces a high percentage of animals with the Pun (pharyngeal unattached) phenotype, whereby the pharynx fails to elongate and form an attachment to the anterior alimentary opening or buccal cavity.

The overall sequence features are consistent with a protein involved in the recognition, unfolding, and translocation of substrates into the proteasome, a function typical of proteasomal ATPases.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nATPase which is responsible for recognizing, binding, unfolding and translocation of pupylated proteins into the bacterial 20S proteasome core particle. May be essential for opening the gate of the 20S proteasome via an interaction with its C-terminus, thereby allowing substrate entry and access to the site of proteolysis. Thus, the C-termini of the proteasomal ATPase may function like a 'key in a lock' to induce gate opening and therefore regulate proteolysis. Protein degradation; proteasomal Pup-dependent pathway. Homohexamer. Assembles into a hexameric ring structure that caps the 20S proteasome core. Strongly interacts with the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup through a hydrophobic interface; the interacting region of ARC lies in its N-terminal coiled-coil domain. There is one Pup binding site per ARC hexamer ring. Upon ATP-binding, the C-terminus of ARC interacts with the alpha-rings of the proteasome core, possibly by binding to the intersubunit pockets. Consists of three main regions, an N-terminal coiled-coil domain that binds to protein Pup and functions as a docking station, an interdomain involved in ARC hexamerization, and a C-terminal ATPase domain of the AAA type.

The presence of multiple glycine-rich repeats (e.g., GQPHGGGW) is indicative of regions that may be involved in structural flexibility or protein-protein interactions. The sequence also contains a high proportion of hydrophobic residues, suggesting potential transmembrane regions or involvement in membrane association. The presence of histidine residues (e.g., HDCVNITVKQHTV) could indicate potential metal-binding sites, which are common in proteins involved in metal ion homeostasis. The overall sequence composition and motifs are reminiscent of prion proteins, which are known for their role in neurodegenerative diseases and their ability to form amyloid fibrils. These proteins often have regions that can undergo conformational changes, leading to aggregation.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nIts primary physiological function is unclear. Has cytoprotective activity against internal or environmental stresses. May play a role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. May be required for neuronal myelin sheath maintenance. May play a role in iron uptake and iron homeostasis. Soluble oligomers are toxic to cultured neuroblastoma cells and induce apoptosis (in vitro). Association with GPC1 (via its heparan sulfate chains) targets PRNP to lipid rafts. Also provides Cu(2+) or Zn(2+) for the ascorbate-mediated GPC1 deaminase degradation of its heparan sulfate side chains (By similarity). Monomer and homodimer. Has a tendency to aggregate into amyloid fibrils containing a cross-beta spine, formed by a steric zipper of superposed beta-strands. Soluble oligomers may represent an intermediate stage on the path to fibril formation. Copper binding may promote oligomerization. Interacts with GRB2, APP, ERI3/PRNPIP and SYN1. Mislocalized cytosolically exposed PrP interacts with MGRN1; this interaction alters MGRN1 subcellular location and causes lysosomal enlargement. Interacts with KIAA1191. Targeted to lipid rafts via association with the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1. Colocates, in the presence of Cu(2+), to vesicles in para- and perinuclear regions, where both proteins undergo internalization. Heparin displaces PRNP from lipid rafts and promotes endocytosis. The normal, monomeric form has a mainly alpha-helical structure. The disease-associated, protease-resistant form forms amyloid fibrils containing a cross-beta spine, formed by a steric zipper of superposed beta-strands. Disease mutations may favor intermolecular contacts via short beta strands, and may thereby trigger oligomerization. Contains an N-terminal region composed of octamer repeats. At low copper concentrations, the sidechains of His residues from three or four repeats contribute to the binding of a single copper ion. Alternatively, a copper ion can be bound by interaction with the sidechain and backbone amide nitrogen of a single His residue. The observed copper binding stoichiometry suggests that two repeat regions cooperate to stabilize the binding of a single copper ion. At higher copper concentrations, each octamer can bind one copper ion by interactions with the His sidechain and Gly backbone atoms. A mixture of binding types may occur, especially in the case of octamer repeat expansion. Copper binding may stabilize the conformation of this region and may promote oligomerization. Variations in PRNP are responsible of transmissible bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE), a class of neurodegenerative diseases that affect various mammals. These diseases are caused by abnormally folded prion proteins. BSE can be subdivided into at least three groups: classical, H-type and L-type, with the latter 2 collectively referred to as atypical BSE. Susceptibility or resistance to a BSE disease can be influenced by at least 3 factors related to the host prion protein: protein expression levels, number of octapeptide repeats, and specific polymorphisms. In cattle, as in humans, BSEs can occur as infectious, spontaneous and genetic diseases.

Required for photoreceptor cell viability after birth (By similarity). Light-induced isomerization of 11-cis to all-trans retinal triggers a conformational change that activates signaling via G-proteins (PubMed:15781694). Subsequent receptor phosphorylation mediates displacement of the bound G-protein alpha subunit by the arrestin SAG and terminates signaling (By similarity). Homodimer (By similarity).

The presence of cysteine residues suggests potential disulfide bond formation, which is common in proteins that require structural stability, such as toxins or enzymes. The sequence contains a high number of hydrophobic residues, which could indicate a role in membrane interaction or insertion. The presence of a motif resembling a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) active site, characterized by the presence of a histidine and aspartate, suggests enzymatic activity related to lipid metabolism. The sequence also includes a glycine-rich region, which is often found in flexible or hinge regions of proteins. These features are consistent with a protein that could be involved in neurotoxic activity, such as a snake venom component. The sequence's characteristics align with known features of crotoxin, a well-studied neurotoxic phospholipase A2 from snake venom.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nHeterodimer CA-CB: Crotoxin is a potent presynaptic neurotoxin that possesses phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity and exerts a lethal action by blocking neuromuscular transmission. It consists of a non-covalent association of a basic and weakly toxic PLA2 subunit (CBa2, CBb, CBc, or CBd), with a small acidic, non-enzymatic and non-toxic subunit (CA1, CA2, CA3 or CA4). The complex acts by binding to a specific 48-kDa protein (R48) receptor located on presynaptic membranes, forming a transient ternary complex CA-CB-R48, followed by dissociation of the CA-CB complex and release of the CA subunit. At equilibrium, only the CB subunits remain associated with the specific crotoxin receptor. In addition to neurotoxicity, crotoxin has been found to exert myotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and cardiovascular toxicity (PubMed:20109480). Moreover, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-tumor and analgesic effects of crotoxin have also been reported (PubMed:20109480). Monomer CBb: The basic subunit of crotoxin is a snake venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) that exhibits weak neurotoxicity (10-fold less than the heterodimer) and strong anticoagulant effects by binding to factor Xa (F10) and inhibiting the prothrombinase activity. In addition, it shows the same effects described for the heterodimer and binds the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR chloride channels and increases the channel current (PubMed:27241308). PLA2 catalyzes the calcium-dependent hydrolysis of the 2-acyl groups in 3-sn-phosphoglycerides. a 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + H2O = a 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + a fatty acid + H(+) Binds 1 Ca(2+) ion. Heterodimer of one of the acidic (CA1, CA2, CA3 or CA4) and one of the basic (CBa1, CBa2, CBb, CBc or CBd) subunits; non-covalently linked. The acidic subunit is non-toxic, without enzymatic activity and comprises 3 peptides that are cross-linked by 5 disulfide bridges. The basic subunit is toxic, has phospholipase A2 activity and is composed of a single chain. Multiple variants of each subunit give different crotoxin complexes that can be subdivided into 2 classes: (1) those of high toxicity, low PLA2 activity (CBb, CBc and CBd linked with high affinity to any CA) and high stability (K(d)=4.5 nM) and (2) those of moderate toxicity, high PLA2 activity (CBa2 linked with low affinity to any CA) and low stability (K(d)=25 nM). Expressed by the venom gland. In monomer CBb, LD(50) is 500 ug/kg by intravenous injection into mice. In class 1 heterodimer CA2-CBb, LD(50) is 110 ug/kg by intravenous injection into mice. In class 1 heterodimer CA3-CBb, LD(50) is 95 ug/kg by intravenous injection into mice. May be used to develop new agents to treat the most common mutation of cystic fibrosis (DelF508CFTR). It shows a double function: (i) as a potentiator, by increasing the chloride channel current, and (ii) as a corrector, by permitting DelF508CFTR to escape from the degradation pathway, facilitating its biosynthesis and subsequent delivery to the plasma membrane. The crotoxin heterodimer is inhibited by the crotoxin inhibitor from Crotalus serum (CICS). CICS neutralizes the lethal potency of crotoxin and inhibits its PLA2 activity. CICS only binds tightly to the CB subunit and induces the dissociation of the heterodimer (By similarity). Tested on the CA2-CBd heterodimer (PubMed:10903514). Belongs to the phospholipase A2 family.

First reason step by step inside a <thinking> block using sequence-derived evidence and structural cues, then provide the final 2–4 sentence description inside an <answer> block.", "response": "<thinking>\nThe sequence analysis reveals several key features indicative of a type II topoisomerase. The presence of conserved motifs such as the ATPase domain and the active site tyrosine, which is crucial for forming a transient covalent bond with DNA, suggests a role in DNA manipulation. The sequence also contains regions that are characteristic of DNA-binding and catalytic activity, typical of enzymes involved in DNA topology modification. The presence of these motifs, along with the overall length and complexity of the sequence, supports the identification of this protein as a type II topoisomerase, specifically a DNA gyrase subunit. These enzymes are known for their ability to introduce negative supercoils into DNA, which is essential for processes such as replication and transcription. Additionally, the sequence suggests the protein forms a heterotetrameric complex, a common structural feature of type II topoisomerases.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nA type II topoisomerase that negatively supercoils closed circular double-stranded (ds) DNA in an ATP-dependent manner to modulate DNA topology and maintain chromosomes in an underwound state. Negative supercoiling favors strand separation, and DNA replication, transcription, recombination and repair, all of which involve strand separation. Also able to catalyze the interconversion of other topological isomers of dsDNA rings, including catenanes and knotted rings. Type II topoisomerases break and join 2 DNA strands simultaneously in an ATP-dependent manner. ATP-dependent breakage, passage and rejoining of double-stranded DNA. Heterotetramer, composed of two GyrA and two GyrB chains. In the heterotetramer, GyrA contains the active site tyrosine that forms a transient covalent intermediate with DNA, while GyrB binds cofactors and catalyzes ATP hydrolysis.

The sequence does not show obvious transmembrane regions, suggesting it is likely a soluble protein. The presence of a potential catalytic triad (serine, histidine, and aspartate) could indicate enzymatic activity, possibly as a protease or hydrolase. The sequence is consistent with a protein that may have multiple roles, including enzymatic activity and regulatory functions, possibly related to stress response or cellular maintenance.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nMultifunctional protein with controversial molecular function which plays an important role in cell protection against oxidative stress and cell death acting as oxidative stress sensor and redox-sensitive chaperone and protease. It is involved in neuroprotective mechanisms like the stabilization of NFE2L2 and PINK1 proteins, male fertility as a positive regulator of androgen signaling pathway as well as cell growth and transformation through, for instance, the modulation of NF-kappa-B signaling pathway. Has been described as a protein and nucleotide deglycase that catalyzes the deglycation of the Maillard adducts formed between amino groups of proteins or nucleotides and reactive carbonyl groups of glyoxals. But this function is rebuted by other works. As a protein deglycase, repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated proteins, and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. Deglycates cysteine, arginine and lysine residues in proteins, and thus reactivates these proteins by reversing glycation by glyoxals. Acts on early glycation intermediates (hemithioacetals and aminocarbinols), preventing the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) that cause irreversible damage. Also functions as a nucleotide deglycase able to repair glycated guanine in the free nucleotide pool (GTP, GDP, GMP, dGTP) and in DNA and RNA. Is thus involved in a major nucleotide repair system named guanine glycation repair (GG repair), dedicated to reversing methylglyoxal and glyoxal damage via nucleotide sanitization and direct nucleic acid repair. Protects histones from adduction by methylglyoxal, controls the levels of methylglyoxal-derived argininine modifications on chromatin. Able to remove the glycations and restore histone 3, histone glycation disrupts both local and global chromatin architecture by altering histone-DNA interactions as well as histone acetylation and ubiquitination levels. Displays a very low glyoxalase activity that may reflect its deglycase activity. Eliminates hydrogen peroxide and protects cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death. Required for correct mitochondrial morphology and function as well as for autophagy of dysfunctional mitochondria. Plays a role in regulating expression or stability of the mitochondrial uncoupling proteins SLC25A14 and SLC25A27 in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and attenuates the oxidative stress induced by calcium entry into the neurons via L-type channels during pacemaking. Regulates astrocyte inflammatory responses, may modulate lipid rafts-dependent endocytosis in astrocytes and neuronal cells. In pancreatic islets, involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and glucose homeostasis in an age- and diet dependent manner. Protects pancreatic beta cells from cell death induced by inflammatory and cytotoxic setting. Binds to a number of mRNAs containing multiple copies of GG or CC motifs and partially inhibits their translation but dissociates following oxidative stress.

Homodimer. Binds EFCAB6/DJBP and PIAS2. Part of a ternary complex containing PARK7, EFCAB6/DJBP and AR. Interacts (via N-terminus) with OTUD7B. Interacts with BBS1, HIPK1, CLCF1 and MTERF. Forms a complex with PINK1 and PRKN (By similarity). Interacts (via C-terminus) with NCF1; the interaction is enhanced by LPS and modulates NCF1 phosphorylation and membrane translocation (By similarity). Interacts with NENF (By similarity). Under normal conditions, located predominantly in the cytoplasm and, to a lesser extent, in the nucleus and mitochondrion. Translocates to the mitochondrion and subsequently to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress and exerts an increased cytoprotective effect against oxidative damage. Membrane raft localization in astrocytes and neuronal cells requires palmitoylation. Sumoylated on Lys-130 by PIAS2 or PIAS4; which is essential for cell-growth promoting activity and transforming activity. Undergoes cleavage of a C-terminal peptide and subsequent activation of protease activity in response to oxidative stress. Belongs to the peptidase C56 family. Glyoxalase activity has been reported. It may however reflect its deglycase activity. The protein deglycation activity is controversial. It has been ascribed to a TRIS buffer artifact by a publication and as a result of the removal of methylglyoxal by glyoxalase activity that leads to a subsequent decomposition of hemithioacetals and hemianimals due to the shift in equilibrium position by another one. However, biochemical experiments showing that PARK7 is a bona fide deglycase have been performed.\n</answer>", "aa_seq": "MASKRALVILAKGAEEMETVIPVDVMRRAGIKVTIAGLAGKDPVQCSRDVVICPDASLEDAKKEGPYDVVVLPGGNLGAQNLSESAAVKEILKEQENRKGLIAAICAGPTALLAHEIGFGSKVTTHPLAKDKMMNGGHYTYSENRVEKDGLILTSRGPGTSFEFALAIVEALNGKEVAAQVKAPLVLKD", "stru_str": "<|chain:A|> <|chain_sep|> #daaeeeeeweaafavllrpllvvlcvllvyhyfhayavwqdwhqynvrdtdggpthlvvvvvvddgleyefgdgpvslvsllpdpsnlvnqvvcqvvqhayeyaalnllscvssvhpfaeeeehapvnvvsncvvnryhydpdqwdddrryiygydsvsslvsslvvscvrpndvssvvsvpvvpddd"}

The nucleophile active site attacks the C1' of nucleotide 34 to detach the guanine base from the RNA, forming a covalent enzyme-RNA intermediate. The proton acceptor active site deprotonates the incoming PreQ1, allowing a nucleophilic attack on the C1' of the ribose to form the product. After dissociation, two additional enzymatic reactions on the tRNA convert PreQ1 to queuine (Q), resulting in the hypermodified nucleoside queuosine (7-(((4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-yl)amino)methyl)-7-deazaguanosine). 7-aminomethyl-7-carbaguanine + guanosine(34) in tRNA = 7-aminomethyl-7-carbaguanosine(34) in tRNA + guanine Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit. tRNA modification; tRNA-queuosine biosynthesis. Homodimer. Within each dimer, one monomer is responsible for RNA recognition and catalysis, while the other monomer binds to the replacement base PreQ1.

It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB1 is part of the core element with the central large cleft, the clamp element that moves to open and close the cleft and the jaws that are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. At the start of transcription, a single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned within the central active site cleft of Pol II. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. During transcription elongation, Pol II moves on the template as the transcript elongates.

First reason step by step inside a <thinking> block using sequence-derived evidence and structural cues, then provide the final 2–4 sentence description inside an <answer> block.", "response": "<thinking>\nThe sequence contains several features indicative of a protein involved in complex formation and regulation. The presence of multiple acidic residues (glutamic acid and aspartic acid) suggests regions that may be involved in protein-protein interactions, possibly through electrostatic interactions. The sequence also contains several lysine residues, which could be sites for post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination or acetylation, often important in regulatory proteins. The presence of motifs such as \"KXXK\" and \"RXXR\" could indicate nuclear localization signals, suggesting a role in cellular processes that occur in the nucleus, such as transcription or translation regulation. The sequence lacks obvious transmembrane domains, indicating it is likely a soluble protein. The presence of repeated sequences and low-complexity regions may suggest a role in binding or scaffolding functions, common in proteins that form part of larger complexes. These features are consistent with a role in translation initiation, particularly as part of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is known to have multiple subunits and is involved in the initiation of protein synthesis.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nComponent of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is required for several steps in the initiation of protein synthesis. The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation. The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression. Component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is composed of 13 subunits: EIF3A, EIF3B, EIF3C, EIF3D, EIF3E, EIF3F, EIF3G, EIF3H, EIF3I, EIF3J, EIF3K, EIF3L and EIF3M. The eIF-3 complex appears to include 3 stable modules: module A is composed of EIF3A, EIF3B, EIF3G and EIF3I; module B is composed of EIF3F, EIF3H, and EIF3M; and module C is composed of EIF3C, EIF3D, EIF3E, EIF3K and EIF3L. EIF3C of module C binds EIF3B of module A and EIF3H of module B, thereby linking the three modules. EIF3J is a labile subunit that binds to the eIF-3 complex via EIF3B. The eIF-3 complex interacts with RPS6KB1 under conditions of nutrient depletion. Mitogenic stimulation leads to binding and activation of a complex composed of MTOR and RPTOR, leading to phosphorylation and release of RPS6KB1 and binding of EIF4B to eIF-3 (By similarity). Phosphorylated. Phosphorylation is enhanced upon serum stimulation (By similarity). Belongs to the eIF-3 subunit C family.\n</answer>", "aa_seq": "MSRFFTTGSDSESESSLSGEELVTKPVGGNYGKQPLLLSEDEEDTKRVVRSAKDKRFEELTNLIRTIRNAMKIRDVTKCLEEFELLGKAYGKAKSIVDKEGVPRFYIRILADLEDYLNELWEDKEGKKKMNKNNAKALSTLRQKIRKYNRDFESHITSYKQNPEQSADEDAEKNEEDSEGSSDEDEDEDGVSAATFLKKKSEAPSGESRKFLKKMDDEDEDSEDSEDDEDWDTGSTSSDSDSEEEEGKQTALASRFLKKAPTTDEDKKAAEKKREDKAKKKHDRKSKRLDEEEEEDNEGGEWERVRGGVPLVKEKPKMFAKGTEITHAVVIKKLNEILQARGKKGTDRAAQIELLQLLVQIAAENNLGEGVIVKIKFNIIASLYDYNPNLATYMKPEMWGKCLDCINELMDILFANPNIFVGENILEESENLHNADQPLRVRGCILTLVERMDEEFTKIMQNTDPHSQEYVEHLKDEAQVCAIIERVQRYLEEKGTTEEVCRIYLLRILHTYYKFDYKAHQRQLTPPEGSSKSEQDQAENEGEDSAVLMERLCKYIYAKDRTDRIRTCAILCHIYHHALHSRWYQARDLMLMSHLQDNIQHADPPVQILYNRTMVQLGICAFRQGLTKDAHNALLDIQSSGRAKELLGQGLLLRSLQERNQEQEKVERRRQVPFHLHINLELLECVYLVSAMLLEIPYMAAHESDARRRMISKQFHHQLRVGERQPLLGPPESMREHVVAASKAMKMGDWKTCHSFIINEKMNGKVWDLFPEADKVRTMLVRKIQEESLRTYLFTYSSVYDSISMETLSDMFELDLPTVHSIISKMIINEELMASLDQPTQTVVMHRTEPTAQQNLALQLAEKLGSLVENNERVFDHKQGTYGGYFRDQKDGYRKNEGYMRRGGYRQQQSQTAY", "stru_str": "<|chain:A|> <|chain_sep|> ################################################pddpqcvlvvqqvvlvvqlvvclvvvpllsnlvsvvsnvvscvscvvvcvpvpddpvvlvsllvlqvslvvcvppppvlvv#dpssnvssvvsnvvsvvvcvvvvvvnvv#vv#######################################################################################################v#vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv#####################################lvvlvvsvvvlvvlppdppdqlvvslvvlvvslvvcvvvv#fllsnlqsllvnlvslvsndvdllaahdpvslvvnlvslvvslvscvvcvleded#################yhyhdslvslvvnvsnlqnvllpddppdpvnvvsvvclvsnlvslvsvqvscvvrndlqsnlssllvnlvsqlqddppl#########################gslnslvvslvscvvrppdvvsnlssllsnlsscllvlvlvvsvvsvvvvpcvvvvvppdllsqlsnllsllsslvscllvlvlvsslvslqvlvvvvfvclsnlvag#########pvvnsvsssshgrpssdddplqsvlsnllslllvqllvcllc#######rphpvnvvllvvqvpppdldddqrssslssqlsvcllclhlvvnlcscddpnncvvhqvprpcsvsssvsslvssllsslssncsncvlpdqkdalvvscvrsvhdsvssvvsvvvcvvvvsfqwdadpvrrmighpnpdddpvrsvvnnvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv###################################"}

A typical microtubule is a hollow water-filled tube with an outer diameter of 25 nm and an inner diameter of 15 nM. Alpha-beta heterodimers associate head-to-tail to form protofilaments running lengthwise along the microtubule wall with the beta-tubulin subunit facing the microtubule plus end conferring a structural polarity. Microtubules usually have 13 protofilaments but different protofilament numbers can be found in some organisms and specialized cells.

The presence of multiple transmembrane domains and conserved motifs aligns with the function of cytochrome b in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, specifically as part of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (complex III). This complex is known to facilitate electron transfer and contribute to the proton gradient used for ATP synthesis. The sequence is consistent with known cytochrome b proteins, which typically bind two heme groups and are integral to the electron transport chain.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nComponent of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex) that is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The b-c1 complex mediates electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c. Contributes to the generation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane that is then used for ATP synthesis. Binds 2 heme b groups non-covalently. The cytochrome bc1 complex contains 11 subunits: 3 respiratory subunits (MT-CYB, CYC1 and UQCRFS1), 2 core proteins (UQCRC1 and UQCRC2) and 6 low-molecular weight proteins (UQCRH/QCR6, UQCRB/QCR7, UQCRQ/QCR8, UQCR10/QCR9, UQCR11/QCR10 and a cleavage product of UQCRFS1). This cytochrome bc1 complex then forms a dimer. Heme 1 (or BL or b562) is low-potential and absorbs at about 562 nm, and heme 2 (or BH or b566) is high-potential and absorbs at about 566 nm. Belongs to the cytochrome b family. The full-length protein contains only eight transmembrane helices, not nine as predicted by bioinformatics tools.\n</answer>", "aa_seq": "MTNMRKNHPLMKIVNHAFIDLPAPSNISSWWNFGSLIGLCLIMQILTGLFLAMHYTSDTTTAFSSVTHICRDVNYGWLIRYLHANGASMFFICLFLHVGRGIYYGSYTMVETWNIGVVLLLTVMATAFMGYVLPWGQMSFWGATVITNLLSAIPYIGTTLVEWIWGGFSVDKATLTRFFAFHFILPFIITALVMVHLLFLHETGSNNPSGLNSDADKIPFHPYYTVKDLLGVFLLLVTLMILVLFFPDILGDPDNYTPANPLNTPAHIKPEWYFLFAYAILRSIPNKLGGVLALILSILILSILPLLHTSKHRAMTFRPLTQFMYWLLVADLLVLTWIGGQPVEYPFIIIGQLASIMYFATIVIFMPIASMIEDNMLKFT", "stru_str": "<|chain:A|> <|chain_sep|> #pdcccvppvsvvvcclafqpwafpfadplvlllvvlvvllvlllvlvvvlvvqadlalvcqlvslvclcppddcsllsvlsnvvslvlnlvslvsnllvclqqlvcllvqlqvlslvlvvlsvllvllvllrnqfqlsfvvvqvvlllqlqpppcscvsscvccvhdgnhssnsvvssvsnncssvvsvvssvsssvscsvpddahqqqddrpvdidtnppvvvvvsvvvvvvsvvvsvccspppsppqddprrnhhhdppdhdpdradglslqllllqllldpgsnnsvvlsvclsvvssclsvlddapgshcnvqvqlvvlsvvlvvlsvlssvlspddpdppsnvssnvssvsnvcsrrprnsvsrvvvcvvvvp#"}

The presence of glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues suggests potential acidic regions, which could be involved in protein-protein interactions or binding to other molecules. The sequence does not show obvious repeats or low-complexity regions that would suggest a structural motif like a coiled-coil. The presence of a potential RING-type zinc finger domain suggests E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is common in proteins involved in ubiquitination pathways. The sequence features are consistent with a protein involved in immune response or protein modification pathways, possibly a member of the TRIM family, which are known for their roles in antiviral defense and ubiquitination.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nCapsid-specific restriction factor that prevents infection from non-host-adapted retroviruses. Blocks viral replication early in the life cycle, after viral entry but before reverse transcription. In addition to acting as a capsid-specific restriction factor, also acts as a pattern recognition receptor that activates innate immune signaling in response to the retroviral capsid lattice. Binding to the viral capsid triggers its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and in concert with the heterodimeric ubiquitin conjugating enzyme complex UBE2V1-UBE2N (also known as UBC13-UEV1A complex) generates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains, which in turn are catalysts in the autophosphorylation of the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex (includes TAK1, TAB2, and TAB3). Activation of the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex by autophosphorylation results in the induction and expression of NF-kappa-B and MAPK-responsive inflammatory genes, thereby leading to an innate immune response in the infected cell. Plays a role in regulating autophagy through activation of autophagy regulator BECN1 by causing its dissociation from its inhibitors BCL2 and TAB2. S-ubiquitinyl-[E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme]-L-cysteine + [acceptor protein]-L-lysine = [E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme]-L-cysteine + N(6)-ubiquitinyl-[acceptor protein]-L-lysine. Protein modification; protein ubiquitination. Can form homodimers and homotrimers. In addition to lower-order dimerization, also exhibits a higher-order multimerization and both low- and high-order multimerizations are essential for its restriction activity. Interacts with BTBD1 and BTBD2. Interacts with PSMC4, PSMC5, PSMD7 and HSPA8/HSC70. Interacts (via B30.2/SPRY domain) with HSPA1A/B. Interacts with PSMC2, MAP3K7/TAK1, TAB2 and TAB3. Interacts with SQSTM1. Interacts with TRIM6 and TRIM34. Interacts with ULK1 (phosphorylated form), GABARAP, GABARAPL1, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3C and BECN1. Predominantly localizes in cytoplasmic bodies. Localization may be influenced by the coexpression of other TRIM proteins, hence partial nuclear localization is observed in the presence of TRIM22 or TRIM27. In cytoplasmic bodies, colocalizes with proteasomal subunits and SQSTM1. The B box-type zinc finger domain and the coiled-coil domain contribute to the higher and low order multimerization respectively which is essential for restriction activity. The coiled coil domain is important for higher order multimerization by promoting the initial dimerization. The B30.2/SPRY domain acts as a capsid recognition domain. Polymorphisms in this domain explain the observed species-specific differences among orthologs (By similarity). The RING-type zinc finger domain confers E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and is essential for retrovirus restriction activity, autoubiquitination and higher-order multimerization. Degraded in a proteasome-independent fashion in the absence of viral infection but in a proteasome-dependent fashion following exposure to restriction sensitive virus. Autoubiquitinated in a RING finger- and UBE2D2-dependent manner. Monoubiquitinated by TRIM21. Deubiquitinated by Yersinia YopJ. Ubiquitination may not lead to proteasomal degradation (By similarity).

The first step of the pathway begins with the non-reducing polyketide synthase tazA that assembles one acetyl-CoA starter unit, five malonyl-CoA units, and catalyzes a series of Claisen condensations, methylation, PT-mediated cyclization, and finally releases the first hexaketide precursor through the R-domain. The tazA product then undergoes reduction on its terminal ketone and the following pyran-ring formation by yet undetermined enzyme(s). Dehydration and enoyl reduction, possibly involving the trans-enoyl reductase tazE leads to the next intermediate. TazD is predicted as an acetyltransferase and might catalyze the acetylation steps leading to the synthesis of azaterrilone A. Azaterrilone A is not the final product of the taz pathway and both the highly reducing polyketide synthase tazB and the dual enzyme tazHJ catalyze late steps of the pathway, leading to the production of the 2 final stereoisomers that contain additional polyketide modification whose structures have still to be determined (Probable).

Unconventional myosins serve in intracellular movements (By similarity). Myosin 6 is a reverse-direction motor protein that moves towards the minus-end of actin filaments (By similarity). Has slow rate of actin-activated ADP release due to weak ATP binding (By similarity). Functions in a variety of intracellular processes such as vesicular membrane trafficking and cell migration (By similarity). Required for the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus via the p53-dependent pro-survival pathway (By similarity). Appears to be involved in a very early step of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in polarized epithelial cells (By similarity). May act as a regulator of F-actin dynamics (By similarity). May play a role in transporting DAB2 from the plasma membrane to specific cellular targets (By similarity). May play a role in the extension and network organization of neurites (By similarity). Modulates RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription (By similarity). Homodimer; dimerization seems to implicate the unfolding of the three-helix bundle region creating an additional calmodulin binding site, and cargo binding (By similarity). Able to function as a monomer under specific conditions in vitro (By similarity). Forms a complex with CFTR and DAB2 in the apical membrane of epithelial cells (By similarity). Binding to calmodulin through a unique insert, not found in other myosins, located in the neck region between the motor domain and the IQ domain appears to contribute to the directionality reversal (By similarity). This interaction occurs only if the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin is occupied by calcium (By similarity). Interaction with F-actin/ACTN1 occurs only at the apical brush border domain of the proximal tubule cells (By similarity). Interacts with DAB2 (By similarity). In vitro, the C-terminal globular tail binds a C-terminal region of DAB2 (By similarity). Interacts with CFTR (By similarity). Interacts with OPTN (PubMed:15837803). Interacts with CABP5 (By similarity). Also present in endocyctic vesicles (By similarity). Translocates from membrane ruffles, endocytic vesicles and cytoplasm to Golgi apparatus, perinuclear membrane and nucleus through induction by p53 and p53-induced DNA damage (By similarity). Recruited into membrane ruffles from cell surface by EGF-stimulation (By similarity). Colocalizes with DAB2 in clathrin-coated pits/vesicles (By similarity). Colocalizes with OPTN at the Golgi complex and in vesicular structures close to the plasma membrane (PubMed:15837803). Divided into three regions: a N-terminal motor (head) domain, followed by a neck domain consisting of a calmodulin-binding linker domain and a single IQ motif, and a C-terminal tail region with a three-helix bundle region, a SAH domain and a unique globular domain required for interaction with other proteins such as cargo-binding. The SAH (single alpha-helix) region is characterized by a high content of charged residues which are predicted to stabilize the alpha-helical structure by ionic bonds (By similarity). Its contribution to the mechanism confering the myosin movement on actin filaments is debated (By similarity).

Swainsonine production occurs via a multibranched pathway and is dispensable for fungal colonization of plants and infection of insect hosts (PubMed:32786262). The first step of swainsonine biosynthesis is the production of the precursor pipecolic acid (PA) via conversion of L-lysine (Lys) to 1-piperideine-6-carboxylate (P6C) by the aminotransferase swnA, the latter being further reduced to PA by the reductase swnR (PubMed:32786262). PA can be converted from lysine by both the SW biosynthetic cluster and the unclustered genes such as lysine cyclodeaminase (PubMed:32786262). The PKS-NRPS hybrid synthetase swnK uptakes and condensates PA and malonyl-CoA with and without skipping of the ketoreductase (KR) domain in order to produce 3 intermediates, 1-oxoindolizidine, (1S)-1-hydroxyindolizin, and (1R)-1-hydroxyindolizine; with the transisomer (1S)-1-hydroxyindolizin being predominant (PubMed:32786262). The terminal thioester reductase (TE) domain of swnK is involved in reduction of the thioester bond to release the intermediate aldehydes (PubMed:32786262). The oxidoreductase swnN could contribute to the reduction of 1-oxoindolizidine to (1S)-1-hydroxyindolizin and (1R)-1-hydroxyindolizine, contributing to the major route of SW production (Probable). The dioxygenase swnH2 would be responsible for the oxidization of (1R)-1-hydroxyindolizine into (1R,2S)-1,2-dihydroxyindolizine and of (1S)-1-hydroxyindolizin to yield both (1R,2S)-1,2-dihydroxyindolizine and (1S,2S)-1,2-dihydroxyindolizine (PubMed:32786262). The dioxygenase swnH1 then performs the conversion of the 1,2-dihydroxyindolizine epimers to SW (PubMed:32786262). Mycotoxin biosynthesis. Homodimer. Abolishes the production of swainsonine but still produces the 1,2-dihydroxyindolizine epimers intermediates. Belongs to the PhyH family.\n</answer>", "aa_seq": "MGAFPPPIDPSYIPSVSLTRLPATAPTADIIATLERDGALILVDLVSPQDVAAINAEIEPYIQKARAESHEAYDLIPKQTIMVPGVVGKSPTMARMAELDVIDTLRTRVLQRKCTATWEDRTEDFSIDPLLNSSLTYHISYGGPRQRLHRDDMIHGIYHRGGEYRLSDETMLGFMIAGSKTTRENGATMAIPGSHKWDHARVPRVDEVCFAEMEPGSALVFLGTVYHGAGHNSVPDQVRKIYGLFFIPGTLRPEENQFLAIPRSKVLGMSDKMLSLLGYKKPGTWLGIVNNGDPAENLAEVLGMANS", "stru_str": "<|chain:A|> <|chain_sep|> ##dfdaaddppfdapddaaedalppdlvvvvvsclqwqkhkhaqlddpvllvqlvvqcvvvqvvqlvp######qfdpqkdkdwlccqrgvsvvvscvppsnqvnqcvqakdwdwdddpvdidififhkafqikmkiwhaaqggkgdwafqcvvvvdffpaddddsnpffkkkkkawsafddlqqwakwwatpqlrdgpvddddpsridgpgghgnmimigtssitiithhhndhpdigmiimtmmghnvddrndllvpshdlvsvvvhdpvncsnnlqfggrdqpsddpsdrcvvpvvvvvvvvvd"}

The sequence's characteristics are consistent with intrinsically disordered proteins, which are known for their flexibility and ability to interact with multiple partners, often involved in stress responses.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nCAHS proteins are cytosolic heat soluble proteins that seem to contribute to the anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, but their specific mechanisms are yet to be identified (PubMed:28306513, PubMed:33545053). It is possible that protection during anhydrobiosis might occur via the stabilization of vitrifying small molecules such as sugars, but not via the direct glass transition of CAHS proteins themselves (Probable). Expression is highly induced during desiccation (PubMed:28306513). CAHS proteins contain 2 repeats of 19-mer peptides designated as CAHS-motifs that comprise each two octapeptides connected by a tripeptide (PubMed:22937162). Results in a significant decrease in survival after desiccation but does not affect survival under frozen conditions (PubMed:28306513). Trehalose, a disaccharide essential for several organisms to survive drying, is detected at low levels or not at all in some tardigrade species, indicating that tardigrades possess potentially novel mechanisms for surviving desiccation involving tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) (PubMed:28306513). Belongs to the Cytosolic-abundant heat soluble protein (CAHS) family. It was suggested that CAHS proteins were intrinsically unstructured and show heat-dependent glass transition, which contributes to the vitrification of cells, and this further leads to desiccation tolerance (PubMed:28306513). However, more recent studies led to the conclusion that there was no evidence supporting glass transition of CAHS proteins to be contributing to the glass transition of the whole tardigrade (PubMed:33545053).\n</answer>", "aa_seq": "MSGRNVESHMERNEKVVVNNSGHADVKKQQQQVEHTEFTHTEVKAPLIHPAPPIISTGAAGLAEEIVGQGFTASAARISGGTAEVHLQPSAAMTEEARRDQERYRQEQESIAKQQEREMEKKTEAYRKTAEAEAEKIRKELEKQHARDVEFRKDLIESTIDRQKREVDLEAKMAKRELDREGQLAKEALERSRLATNVEVNFDSAAGHTVSGGTTISSSDKMEIKRN", "stru_str": "<|chain:A|> <|chain_sep|> ###############################################p#p######################################ddpvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv###############################"}
